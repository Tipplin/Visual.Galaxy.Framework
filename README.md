## Introduction
#### Visual Galaxy Framework is just a great application as .NET Assembly 
#### organized Namespaces, Classes, Methods in a hierarchical manner.
#### Use for any Project, any Application.
----
## Background:
#### Every time I work on some project, I always find myself digging through books and 
#### my old files to see how I did one or another piece of code.
#### Although it works, it usually requires a lot of time. 
#### Sites like Codeplex (!closed yet), CodeProject and GitHub or others keeps code always available, 
#### but if I am offline or on a remote location without the connectivity, 
#### then I have always wanted a application that keeps the code organized and handy.
